This is a guide for 3D printing parts for LucidGloves prototype 3.  
These instructions are meant for FDM printers. This should apply to almost any FDM printer.  

**Recommended Nozzle Diameter: 0.4**  

These parts are specifically designed to **not** need supports so do not turn on support structures unless you need to.  

All parts for prototype 3 are designed to be printed flat. Print them in the following orientations for the best finish:

STL files for 3D printing are located in the hardware folder. 

The assembly **for each hand** is as follows:
* Spool (5x)
* Tensioner (5x)
* Cover (5x)
* Holder (5x)
* GuideRing OR GuideNode(3.1) (2+ per finger, 1+ for thumb | 9 Per hand, 8 without thumb)
* EndCap (1x per finger, can be substituted for smaller guide ring) 

Recommended settings:
* Infill: 10-20%, you can go higher if your layer adhesion needs it
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* No supports (brims are okay)
* Shell thickness: 0.8mm (2 outlines)
* Retraction settings: May differ between printers, 5mm on Ender 3 is fine


Disclaimer: You WILL need to print multiple sizes of the EndCap and GuideRing to fit the size of your fingers. Resize these in your slicer. Alternatively, you could print them in TPU for more flexible sizing. I recommend resizing the EndCaps non-uniformly to squish them down to fit the oval shape of your fingers, this way they don't rotate around.

If your bed is big and level enough, you may be able to print all the parts at once, but feel free to print them individually as well, you may get higher yield printing individually.
