These are the parts you will need for prototype 4 with recommended links to buy (make sure you get the right ones)  
Currently, these are US links, but I will hopefully have UK/EU options later on.

**Keep in mind that prices for these parts change a lot, and some of these links are higher quantity, so if you want to reach the $60/pair mark you may need to shop around.**

1. b10k ohm Potentiometer (5x per hand)  
   - You will also need the nuts that are included with the potentiometers. 
   - Green or WL potentiometers are supported.
   - WL (brass) potentiometers:

     - [Recommended Aliexpress Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32869141485.html)
   - Green Potentiometers (Smaller and more durable):

     - [Recommended Aliexpress Link (10K Ohm)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33011428749.html)

2. 9g servo motors for haptics(5x per hand)
   - Make sure they are 180-degree range.
   - MG90S servos are recommended for higher durability
     - [Recommended Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/RGBZONE-Geared-Helicopter-Airplane-Controls/dp/B07R3ZYQLC/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1V8YVESJQ17JZ&keywords=mg90s&qid=1643044117&sprefix=mg90s%2Caps%2C49&sr=8-11)
   - SG90 servos can also be used as a cheaper alternative

3. ESP32 Dev Board or Arduino (1x per hand)
   - Recommended Board Types:
   - ESP-WROOM-32
     - [Recommended Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Development-Bluetooth-Microcontroller-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B07QCP2451/ref=sr_1_5)
     - [Recommended Aliexpress Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32864722159.html)
   - ESP32-WROOM-32U (For external antenna)
     - [Recommended Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Rakstore-ESP32-DevKitC-Development-WROOM-32U-ESP32-WROOM-32U/dp/B09BM1QW29/ref=sr_1_10)
     - [Recommended Aliexpress Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32864722159.html)
   - Arduino Nano (No bluetooth)
     - [Recommended Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Emakefun-Arduino-Micro-ATmega328P-Micro-Controller/dp/B07QQJRLDG)
     - [Recommended Aliexpress Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000009207563.html)
     - If not using BT, may need a long USB cable to connect your arduino to your computer if you don't have one

4. Cheap retractable badge reels (for the rotary springs, 5x per hand)
   - [Recommended Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Retractable-Badge-Reel-Holder-Clip/dp/B0732Z7T8W/ref=sxin_9)



5. Glove material of your choice.
   - Recommended: Nylon Inspection Gloves (more flexy), Cycling/Golf gloves (stronger, easier to put on)

6. Mounting material
   - Velcro strap for the rigid mount (could add elastic as well), or elastic only

7. Wiring/Connectors/Breadboards as needed.
   - I recommend crimping/using JST connectors, 5 pin JST-XH 2.54mm fit great on the potentiometers.
   - [A great first crimper set (optional, sometimes $35)](https://www.amazon.com/Qibaok-Crimping-Ratcheting-Connectors-0-1-0-5mm%C2%B2/dp/B07ZK5F8HP/ref=sr_1_12)
   - If you're in a pinch you can probably get away with soldering straight to the potentiometers, or using pre-crimped dupont wires from arduino kits.

8. Highly Recommended: A Can of WD-40 to lubricate the potentiometers
   - This makes the pots feel 10x smoother. 
   - WD-40 is flammable so spray at your own risk.
   - Potential alternatives: (UNTESTED) Deoxit, Triflow

9. A source of power for the servos
   - Ideally 5v 2+ amps
   - This can be anything from a phone charger brick, to a USB battery, or even 4x AA batteries.
   - If you are using bluetooth you may want to invest in a separate clean source of power for the ESP32 to prevent brownouts.
   - [A Personal Favorite Choice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094G1GL8T/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_DW1G0CYTDMAXEMEMPS3Y?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) (Pack of 2)

10. If using the rigid mount, a nice squishy sheet of foam
