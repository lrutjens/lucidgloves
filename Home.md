# Getting Started #
So you want to have yourself a pair of working VR Haptic Gloves?  
Here's what you'll need to do.  

### Parts ###
First, you'll need to buy/have the correct parts. Here's what you'll need to order:  
[For **Prototype 3**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-3.1-Parts-List) (Just finger tracking)  
[For **Prototype 4**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-4-Parts-List) (Tracking and Haptics)  

### 3D Printing ###
Next, you'll need to 3D print the plastic parts needed to put it together. Here's how:  
[For **Prototype 3**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-3-Printing-Guide)  
[For **Prototype 4**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-4-Printing-Guide) 

If you don't have access to a printer, you can ask around in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/lucidvr).   
There are people that may be able to send parts or alternative designs that don't require printers.  

### Assembling ###
Next, you can build the glove. Here's how:

[For **Prototype 4**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-4-Building-Tutorial)

### Wiring ###
Next, you'll have to wire up the electronics. Here's how to do that:  
[For **Prototype 3**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-3-Wiring-Diagram)  
[For **Prototype 4**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Prototype-4-Wiring-Diagram)  

### Software/Firmware ###
Next, you can flash the firmware onto your glove to make it work.  
[**Here's how to do that.**](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Firmware-Setup-and-Customization-Tutorial)

Once you're done with that, your glove should be functional.
Now all you need to do is install and configure the [**OpenGloves** driver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574050/OpenGloves/) to use it in VR.


### Additional Support ###
You can get great support on any issues in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/lucidvr).
