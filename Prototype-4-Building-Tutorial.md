# How to Build Prototype 4
Images are currently missing from this wiki as it is a WIP but they will be added piecewise.  
### Assembling the Spools
The spool assembly process is virtually identical to prototype 3.1.   
Refer to 3:51-5:52 in the [Prototype 3.1 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Qj4hqRKiy8g?t=231).    
(Photo instructions for spools will also be added here later on)

### Assembling the Modules
This process is *briefly* covered in the [Prototype 4 Overview Video](https://youtu.be/ZTzn37Usa-U?t=172).  
Fit the potentiometer into the holder piece (the square hole for green pots or the round hole for WL pots).  
Use a pair of pliers to remove the metal loops from the badge reel ends, and then clamp them to the plastic loops on the holders.  
Run the strings through these metal loops.
  
### Setting up the rigid mount
Take your rigid mount piece and glue a layer of foam on the bottom.  
Optionally also use the two circular holes to add a loop of elastic (that will go in front of the thumb)  
Next, add a velcro strap between the two loops of the rigid mount. Trim it so that you can strap it on your hand nicely.  
Once you have it mounted on your hand, you can now slide the modules onto the rigid mount.  
You may need to slide some on backward, depending on the size of your hand, in order to get the string to come out at the right place. 

### Gluing up the nodes and caps
This process is virtually identical to prototype 3.1.  
Refer to 6:03-6:12 in the [Prototype 3.1 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Qj4hqRKiy8g?t=363).  
Follow the process of stringing the glove at 6:28.  
(Photo instructions will be added later on)

### Adding Haptics
You may want to save this step until you have working firmware on your glove.  
Once you have working finger tracking, you fit the servo motors into their respective slots on each assembly.
Use the single direction servo head and place it on the gear. 
You will need to do some trial and error to find the right rotation of the servo head, but you can use the "extend/retract servos fully" buttons in the openglove UI to help you. You want to get it where your hand is fully limited open when the servos are extended, and not limited at all when the servos are retracted.
